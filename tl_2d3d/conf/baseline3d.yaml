model:
  num_dimensions: 3   # 2 or 3 - for 2D or 3D nothing else pls

data:
  image_dims: [256, 256, 32] # what size should the images/volumes be resized to 38 is the median of the 'A' dataset
  crop_size: [-1, -1, -1] # whether to crop the 3D volume to a 2d slice, if [-1,-1,1] will crop. if [-1,-1,-1] wont crop. kinda shitty way of doing it
